purchased at a restaurant. It will prompt the user to enter the charge

charge by 18% and the sales tax by 7%. The program will display each amount;
the food charge, the tip, sales tax, and total amount of meal.

sales_tax = food_charge * 0.07

total = food_charge + tip + sales_tax

print(f"Food charge: ${food_charge:.2f}")
